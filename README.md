The HONG.  A DO contract
========================
The contract is based on the white paper of http://HongCoin.org, and the collaborative works from community, to create and manage a blockchain-based fund across borders. Some legal and finance related details will be bonded not only in these contracts, but also bounded to ground jurisdiction linking to the management firm.
